Active Directory Users and Computers script changelog

v.0.1.0 - 3/23/2020

Got started on creating functionality for editing users and computers, but
there isn't too much that is completed right now. I plan on holding off on
this script until I get a testing environment up and running.

v 0.5.0 - 3/31/2020

- Finished up some functionality on the user and computer ends of things, need
to test before going any further

v 0.6.0 - 4/2/2020

- Completely finished functionality for the features in place and they have
all been tested to work just as intended. Features right now are as follows:
	
	-Granting/removing drive access
	-Enabling/disabling users
	-Creating new computer objects
	-Editing computer descriptions
	-Moving computer objects

- Currently working on giving some divergence to the script and adding
functions to where the user can go back to certain places in the script. I've
added quite a few functions to help accomplish this task.
- Worked on cleaning up the standard output a little 
- Added some QoL changes such as showing the status of an account after it is
enabled/disabled or showing the list of users when prompting the user for a
user

v 1.0.0 - 4/6/2020

- Finished up adding divergence to the script. Users can jump between
configuring users/computers and they can have access to other functions once
they are done with the current one. 
- Cleaned up the standard output completely so that it looks nice and neat

v 1.0.1 - 5/4/2020

- Cleaned up comments and spacing
