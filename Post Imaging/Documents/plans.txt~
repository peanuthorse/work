Ideas for post-imaging script:

Allow the end user to:

Update Windows 
Install any necessary software (software request, VPN, Dell Command Update/HP Support Assistant)
Make client local admin 

Stuff to add/change:
Make the Windows installation silent
Make it so that the end user can go to any point in the script

Test functionality for:
Windows Updates - works but needs to be silent
BIOS Updates
Local admin
Cisco VPN
Installing software
Enabling optional features
