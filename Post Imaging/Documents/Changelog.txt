Post-Imaging Script Changelog

v. 0.1.0 - 3/23/2020

- Created the script and got a little started on implementing options for
Windows Updates but didn't get very far

v. 0.3.0 - 3/25/2020

- Added code for other actions (install VPN, BIOS, local admin)
- Mostly finished the code for Windows Updates
- Added a huge block of code that just elevates the prompt
- Haven't really properly tested the other features besides Windows Updates
- Planning on reworking the code for BIOS updates 

v. 0.5.0 - 3/26/2020

- Revamped how BIOS updates worked, have yet to finish on the HP portion
- Added some QoL progress bars for installations and implemented silent installs
for Cisco VPN and other software that don't need manual installation
- Added enabling optional features as a sixth choice
- Added the ability to install additional lab software as a fifth choice,
currently under development

v. 0.6 - 3/27/2020

- Added small text output changes to Windows Updates
- HP Support Assistant is just in its own folder now and the script will just
call to it from there instead of on the Internet like Dell Command Update
- Developed the lab software installation option a bit more. It seems I have
achieved functionality with installing Anaconda but I'm not sure about the
rest.

v. 0.6.5 - 3/30/2020

- I've created a BUNCH of functions and conditional statements within the
software installation area not only for organizational purposes but also so
that I could cut down a massive amount of code 
- Outside of the software installation function, I've made every other action
a function. This is so that the script can call back to those functions if the
user ever wants to complete another action. 
- I've also gotten rid of the $b variable which made blank lines since I
realized I could just type in "`n" by itself instead of appending echo or
Write-Host to it
- Replaced all the "echo" functions with "Write-Host" 
rest. Right now there's a lot of functions within functions and variables
within variables.
