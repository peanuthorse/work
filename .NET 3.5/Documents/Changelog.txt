.NET 3.5 script changelog

v1.0 - 3/25/2020

The script disables a registry key that has the computer download from UNL's WSUS servers so that it can download from Microsoft's servers instead.
After the script disables the key, the user is then asked if they want to enable a feature
Once the user is done enabling features, the registry key is turned back on again

revamp v.1.0 - 3/27/2020

- Changed the script to enable .NET 3.5 only as opposed to giving options to
install other optional features. Having that sort of functionality was
redundant and I only wanted to have fun with it. 

v. 1.0.1 - 5/4/2020

- Cleaned up comments
- Replaced aliases with full commands
- Updated opening prompt so that it says ".NET 3.5" instead of "Optional
Features Script"
